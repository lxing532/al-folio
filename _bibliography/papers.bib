  title={Incorporating Metadata into Content-Based User Embeddings},
  author={Linzi Xing and Michael Paul},
  abstract={Low-dimensional vector representations of social media users can benefit applications like recommendation systems and user attribute inference. Recent work has shown that user embeddings can be improved by combining different types of information, such as text and network data. We propose a data augmentation method that allows novel feature types to be used within off-the-shelf embedding models. Experimenting with the task of friend recommendation on a dataset of 5,019 Twitter users, we show that our approach can lead to substantial performance gains with the simple addition of network and geographic features.},

@article{xing2017suicide,
  title={Exploring Timelines of Confirmed Suicide Incidents through Social Media},
  author={Xiaolei Huang and Linzi Xing and Jed Brubaker and Michael Paul},
  abstract={Suicide is one of leading causes of death worldwide, yet little data is available about the lives of suicide victims because most people do not seek treatment. Research has shown that people express suicidal ideation in social media, which can potentially be tapped to improve our understanding of the thoughts and behaviors of people prior to suicide. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset of Chinese social media accounts of 130 people who committed suicide between 2011 and 2016. We describe the demographic and geographic composition of the users, then conduct a longitudinal text analysis of their post histories, showing observable changes in content leading up to the time of death. With encouraging exploratory findings, we discuss directions for future research.},

@article{xing2018stability,
  title={Diagnosing and Improving Topic Models by Analyzing Posterior Variability},
  author={Linzi Xing and Michael Paul},
  abstract={Bayesian inference methods for probabilistic topic models can quantify uncertainty in the parameters, which has primarily been used to increase the robustness of parameter estimates. In this work, we explore other rich information that can be obtained by analyzing the posterior distributions in topic models. Experimenting with latent Dirichlet allocation on two datasets, we propose ideas incorporating information about the posterior distributions at the topic level and at the word level. At the topic level, we propose a metric called topic stability that measures the variability of the topic parameters under the posterior. We show that this metric is correlated with human judgments of topic quality as well as with the consistency of topics appearing across multiple models. At the word level, we experiment with different methods for adjusting individual word probabilities within topics based on their uncertainty. Humans prefer words ranked by our adjusted estimates nearly twice as often when compared to the traditional approach. Finally, we describe how the ideas presented in this work could potentially applied to other predictive or exploratory models in future work.},
