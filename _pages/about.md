Hi! Welcome to my homepage!

I am now a master student at [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu), major in [Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/). I work with [Prof. Michael J. Paul](http://cmci.colorado.edu/~mpaul/). My research interests mainly focuse on combining probablistic based natural language processing technologies and their applications on social media datasets.

I received my Bachelor degree of Management Information System from [Soochow University](http://eng.suda.edu.cn/), under the supervison of [Prof. Li Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li_Zhang80).

I will join the Computer Science Department of University of British Columbia as a Ph.D. student this fall.
