Hi! Welcome to my homepage!

I am now a master student at [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/). I am honored to work with [Prof. Michael J. Paul](http://cmci.colorado.edu/~mpaul/). My research interests are mainly about probablistic based NLP applications on social media datasets.

Formerly, I received my MIS Bachelor degree from [Soochow University](http://eng.suda.edu.cn/), under the supervison of [Prof. Li Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li_Zhang80).

I will join the Computer Science Department, University of British Columbia as a Ph.D. student this fall.
