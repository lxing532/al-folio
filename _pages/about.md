Hi! Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of British Columbia.

I received my master degree of Computer Science from [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu) under the supervison of [Prof. Michael J. Paul](http://cmci.colorado.edu/~mpaul/). I received my Bachelor degree of Management Information System from [Soochow University](http://eng.suda.edu.cn/), under the supervison of [Prof. Li Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li_Zhang80). 

My research interests are mainly on probablistic natural language model and the application on social media datasets.
