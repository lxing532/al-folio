Hi! Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at University of British Columbia, working on NLP and under the supervision of [Professor Giuseppe Carenini](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/).

I obtained my M.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science, [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu) in 2018 under the supervison of [Professor Michael J. Paul](http://cmci.colorado.edu/~mpaul/). Before that, I received my B.S. degree from School of Computer Science & Technology, [Soochow University](http://eng.suda.edu.cn/) in 2016.

I am interested in natural language processing, machine learning and social computing. Particularly, I am working on the evaluation of topic model, as well as novel methods to integrate topic models with neural-based models.
